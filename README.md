This is built for the Readable final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

 Now we can make sure every file is formatted correctly by adding a few lines to the `package.json` in the project root.
